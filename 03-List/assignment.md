1. When inserting a new node in the beginning or at the end of in doubly linked list, explain whether or not ‘dinsert_node’ can be used in p41 of ‘DS-Lec04-List.pdf’. If so, explain the reason. Otherwise, implement ‘dinsert_first_node’ and ‘dinsert_last_node’.


2. Suppose two linked lists `a = {a1,a2, ... ,am}` and b = `{b1,b2, ... ,bm}`  are sorted in an ascending order. Implement a merge function using a linked list that generates a new linked list c by merging a and b. Here, elements should be sorted in an ascending order. Show the result using the following example. Also, analyze the time complexity (upper bound Ο or tight bound θ) of this function.

`a = {1,2,5,10,15,20,25}` , `b = {3,7,8,15,18,30}`
→ `c = {1,2,3,5,7,6,10,15,15,18,20,25,30}`



3. When a linked list is defined as below, re-implement all functions in ‘List ADT’ (p55-p61) as well as add_first, add_last, delete_first, delete_last. Then, run the following example code.
